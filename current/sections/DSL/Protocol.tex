\subsection{\glsfmtlong{Protocol}}
\label{subsec:protocol}

The RSS3 Protocol is used to structure \glsfmtlong{OI} for interoperability \cite{protocol}.

\glsfmtlong{OI}, indexed from multiple \glspl{PDS}, is structured by \glspl{Node} into the \gls{Protocol} format for interoperability.

\glspl{PDS} use different data structures, within a \gls{PDS}, there might be multiple products, services, and protocols that leverage a different data structure to suit their needs.
This lack of standardization means limited interoperability, limiting the creation of scalable applications.

The \gls{Protocol} addresses this issue by offering a unified set of data structures that serve as an abstraction.
This abstraction simplifies the integration process, making it more manageable and scalable for developers to work with data across various \glspl{PDS}.
