\subsection{RSS3 \glsfmtfull{Node}}
\label{subsec:SN}

A \gls{Node}, also known as an RSS3 Node, is responsible for indexing, transforming, storing, and ultimately serving the \glsfmtlong{OI} to the end users.

The operation of a \gls{Node} is permissionless and is subject to a set of requirements set by the Network.

\subsubsection{Indexing}
Each \gls{Node} operates a number of workers that index and structure \gls{OI} from \gls{PDS}.
Workers are community-maintained ``rules'' that define how \gls{OI} is indexed and transformed into the \gls{Protocol} format.

Since each \gls{Node} is independent, it is possible for different \glspl{Node} to employ different combinations of workers to cover different \glspl{PDS}.
This design enables node operation to be flexible, accessible, and affordable, in turn offering a high degree of decentralization and robustness.

\subsubsection{Serving}
Each \gls{Node} operates a standard set of interfaces that serve structured \gls{OI} in \gls{Protocol} to the end users via a \gls{GI}.

Each successful request served on the \gls{DSL} is recorded, and the corresponding \glsfmtlong{Fee} paid by requesters are distributed to the \gls{Node};
See \Cref{subsubsec:operation_pool} for more details.
