\section{\glsfmtlong{DSL}}
\label{sec:DSL}

The \glsfirst{DSL} is responsible for \glsfmtlong{OI} life cycle management, which includes indexing, transformation, storage, dissemination, and consumption \cite{nationalinstituteofstandardsandtechnology2016Information}.
In this section, we introduce the \gls{DSL} and its fundamental components; see \Cref{fig:DSL}.

The \gls{DSL} is formed by two components (see \cref{subsec:SN} and \cref{subsec:GI}) and uses the \gls{Protocol} (see \cref{subsec:protocol}) to structure the information for applications in social, search, AI and beyond.
