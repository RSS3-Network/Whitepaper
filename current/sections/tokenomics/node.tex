\subsection{Node Operation}
\Glsfmtlong{NO}s are incentivized to operate and maintain the Network by receiving \$RSS3 as rewards.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Anyone can become a \glsfmtlong{NO} to launch an RSS3 Node and join the RSS3 Network without requiring prior permission.
    \item A \glsfmtlong{NO} has the ability to configure the Node's coverage, which directly influences the Node's capability to respond to various types of requests. A broader coverage means more computational resources are required, and an increased likelihood of receiving requests.
    \item A Node can be operated in either a Normal mode as \node or a Public Good mode as \publicGoodNode. A Normal Node is eligible for \glsfmtlong{NR} but requires a deposit of \$RSS3 into its \operationPool. A Public Good Node is ineligible for \glsfmtlong{NR} but requires no deposit.
    \item A Normal Node has a corresponding \operationPool\ and a \stakingPool. All Public Good Nodes collectively share a single \publicGoodPool.
\end{enumerate}
