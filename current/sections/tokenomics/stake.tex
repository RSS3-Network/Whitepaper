\subsection{Staking, Trust, and Chip}
Network participants are incentivized to secure and improve the Network with their \$RSS3 tokens.

\subsubsection{Staking}

A Normal Node accepts staking into its \stakingPool;
The amount of staked \$RSS3 signifies its quality and reliability, and this increases the likelihood of receiving requests for a Node.

\subsubsection{Trust}

A Public Good Node does not have a \glsfmtlong{SP} and does not participate in any form of incentivization. Instead, network participants may choose to entrust such a Node, and their tokens are stored in a \glsfmtlong{PGP}. The trust level affects the likelihood of routing requests to a Public Good Node.

\subsubsection{Chip}

A Chip \chip\ is an ERC-721 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) representing a network participant's stake in a particular Node.
When a network participant stakes or entrusts tokens to a Node \node, the participant automatically receives Chips RSS3-\node\ ($\chip_\node$).

\paragraph{Minting}
The number of Chips minted for a particular staking or entrusting \staking\trust\ is determined by:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:chip_supply}
    \chip_{\node_\text{mint}} = 
    \frac{\staking\trust * \max(1, \chip_{\node_\text{total}})}{\stakingPool}
\end{equation}

Where $\chip_{\node_\text{mint}} \in \mathbb Z_{> 0}$ is always a non-negative integer.

\paragraph{Redemption}
A Chip can be redeemed for its underlying staked or entrusted tokens at any time, subject to a waiting period imposed by the Network.
The redemption amount may be different from the original staking or entrusting amount due to the change of the underlying \stakingPool\ balance, which follows the same formula as \Cref{eq:chip_supply}:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:chip_redeem}
    \staking\trust_{\text{redeem}} = 
    \frac{\chip_{\node_\text{redeem}} * \stakingPool}{\max(1, \chip_{\node_\text{total}})}
\end{equation}
