\section{Introduction}

RSS3 is the \glsfmtlong{OIL}, structuring \glsfmtlong{OI}. It is RSS3's mission to construct the \glsfmtlong{OW} by enhancing the free flow of \glsfmtlong{OI}.

Inspired by the original RSS standard \cite{rssadvisoryboard2009RSS} and the spirit of openness it represents, the \gls{OIL} aims to be a decentralized and permissionless layer where information flows openly without any restrictions.
