# RSS3 Whitepaper

This repository contains the source code for all versions of the RSS3 Whitepaper.
The Whitepaper has to be updated from time to time to reflect the latest changes in the landscape of the Open Web, and to ensure that the RSS3 Network stays relevant.

The Whitepaper in a way serves as the 'Constitution' of the RSS3 Network.
It defines the architecture of the Network and the tokenomics around it.

[RSS3 Evolution Proposals (REPs)](https://github.com/RSS3-Network/REPs) are the decentralized governance mechanism used to propose changes to the Network or even the Whitepaper itself.
