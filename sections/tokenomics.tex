\section{Tokenomics}
\label{sec:tokenomics}

In this seciton, we introduce the detailed tokenomics of the \glsfmtlong{R3N}. We present the \glsfmtlong{NR}'s calculation and distribution formulas, and the slashing mechanism employed to enforce network security and stability.

\subsection{\glsfmtfull{NR}}
IN \Cref{sec:VSL}, we describe the intentions behind the \gls{VSL}'s incentive mechanism, here we introduce the detailed \glsfmtlong{NR} calculation and distribution formulas separately.

The \glsfmtlong{NR} \networkReward\ consists of three parts: 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:network_rewards}
    \networkReward = (\operationReward + \stakingReward) + \publicGoodReward
\end{equation}

See \Cref{fig:network-rewards} for an illustration.

\subsubsection{\glsfmtfull{OR}}
To encourage Normal Nodes to operate and maintain the Network, \operationReward\ is allocated to a Node's \operationPool\ in proportion to the fees collected from its work contribution.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:operation_weight}
    \tilde{\fee}_\nodeAtEpoch = \log_{2}(\frac{\fee_\nodeAtEpoch}{\sum_{x=0}^{\infty} \fee_{x, \epoch}} + 1) * G
\end{equation}

$\tilde{\fee}_\nodeAtEpoch$ denotes the normalized work contribution for a given Node \node, at the end of a given epoch $\epoch$. $G$ is a constant equal to $\ln(2) \approx 0.693147$ used to offset the effect of replacing $\ln$ with $\log_2$, as the former is more costly in terms of gas when it comes to on-chain computation.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:operation_rewards}
    \networkReward_{\operation|\node, \epoch} = \frac{\tilde{\fee}_{\node, \epoch}}{\sum_{x=0}^{\infty} \tilde{\fee}_{x, \epoch}} * \networkReward_{\operation, \epoch}
\end{equation}

$\networkReward_{\operation|\node, \epoch}$ therefore denotes the Operation Rewards for a given Node \node, at the end of a given epoch $\epoch$.

\subsubsection{\glsfmtfull{SR}}

To encourage participation from all network participants to increase the Network's reliability, \stakingReward\ is allocated to a Node's \stakingPool\ in proportion to the amount of staked tokens in the entire Network.
