\section{Data Sub-layer}

The \gls{DSL} is responsible for information life cycle management, which includes indexing, transformation, storage, dissemination, and consumption \cite{nationalinstituteofstandardsandtechnology2016Information}.

\subsection{Unified Metadata Schemas}

Open Information, indexed from multiple data sources, is structured into the \gls{UMS} format for interoperability.

Decentralized data sources use different data structures, within a DDS, there might be multiple products, services and protocols that leverage a different data structure to suit their needs. This means limited interoperability, and developers need to look into each and every data structure, when it comes to building. This lack of standardization means developers must investigate each unique structure individually when building applications, which is not scalable.

The UMS addresses this issue by offering a unified set of data structures that serve as an abstraction. This abstraction simplifies the integration process, making it more manageable and scalable for developers to work with data across various data sources.

For the complete set of the \gls{UMS}, refer to \url{https://docs.rss3.io/docs/unified-metadata-schemas}.
