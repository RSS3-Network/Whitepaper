\section{Conclusion} 
We have presented the design of the decentralized RSS3 Network that is capable of efficiently handling Open Information indexing, structuring, disseminating, and materializing without relying on a centralized entity.

The dual Sublayer architecture combines the \gls{DSL} and the \gls{VSL} to ensure efficient information indexing and integrate an ownership economy.
While enabling interoperability through the RSS3 Protocol, the Network breaks down barriers in information accessibility and paves the way for a more inter-connected digital future. 
By integrating a customized Optimistic rollup scaling solution and a robust tokenomics model, the RSS3 Network enhances the flow and value of information across permissionless platforms on the Open Web.

We hope to continue contributing to the evolution of the RSS3 Network into the backbone of the future Internet that is truly open and inter-connected.
