\section{\glsfmtlong{R3N}}

The \glsfmtlong{R3N} is a decentralized network that is formed by two sub-layers: the \glsfirst{DSL} and the \glsfirst{VSL}

\gls{OI} is typically found across various types of networks, including decentralized, federated, and centralized networks that allow permissionless access.
The \gls{DSL} is responsible for indexing and structuring \gls{OI} for interoperability. 
This is achieved by introducting a crucial standard, known as the \gls{UMS}, see \Cref{subsec:UMS}, enabling network-agnostic applications to be built on top of the \gls{DSL}.
The \gls{DSL} then leverages the \gls{VSL}, see \Cref{sec:VSL}, to build an ownership economy on the \gls{OW}.

\$RSS3 is the Network's native utility token. It is used to pay query fees, operate nodes, participate in staking, and engage in various network activities.
